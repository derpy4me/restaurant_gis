# Overview

This ARC GIS application contains a small application to grab the user's current location and display the 20 highest rated restaurants near the user. The website will display a map with 20 dots int eh center of Salt Lake City. To get the restaurants near the user's location, the user needs to click the locate button in the top left and then reload the page.

This application was an opportunity to learn ARC GIS and pave the way to creating more applications that could help user's find nice places to eat.
